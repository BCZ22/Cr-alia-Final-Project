# Blockers for Project Launch Readiness

This document lists technical blockers that require manual intervention.

## 1. Local Database Connection Failure

**- Date:** 2025-10-25
**- Blocker:** The `prisma migrate` command is failing due to an authentication error with the local PostgreSQL database.
**- Error Message:** `P1000: Authentication failed against database server...`
**- Impact:** Database schema migrations cannot be applied. This prevents changes like renaming the `AIArtGeneration` table to `Generation` from being reflected in the database.
**- Action Required:** The `.env` file needs to be updated with the correct `DATABASE_URL` for the local development environment. The current value is the default placeholder: `postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase`.

### Mitigation Strategy

To proceed with development, I will:
1.  **Assume Migrations are Successful:** Continue development as if the schema changes have been applied.
2.  **Mock Database Interactions:** For API endpoints that interact with the database (e.g., creating a `Generation` record), I will mock the Prisma client's responses.
3.  **Continue with API and Frontend:** Focus on building the required API routes (`/api/studio/generate/[tool]`) and integrating them with the frontend, using mocked data where necessary.

Once the `DATABASE_URL` is corrected, the pending migrations can be run to sync the database schema.

✅ **Storybook & Visual Tests:**
- **Status:** ⚠️ Blocked
- **Blocker:** `npm install` fails for Storybook due to conflicting peer dependencies (`storybook@8.6.14` vs `storybook@9.1.15`).
- **Attempted Fixes:** `npm i --legacy-peer-deps` did not resolve the issue.
- **Action Required:** The `package.json` dependencies need to be manually audited and aligned to compatible versions for Storybook. This requires a developer to resolve the version conflicts.
- **Mitigation:** I will skip the Storybook and visual regression testing setup for now to avoid breaking the project's dependencies. I will proceed with the remaining tasks.
